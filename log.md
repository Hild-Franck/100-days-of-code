# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some neat physics to player movements

**Thoughts**: Well, after adding the jump, I kind of forgot that x and y speed values added each other. I'll have to use... VECTOR CALCULATIONS. Thankfully, I already did that in previous projects.

### Day 2: January 12, 2017 - Jump Research

**Today's Progress**: Added boundaries to the world to prevent player from falling or walking out the canvas

**Thoughts**: Testing jump was a LITTLE annoying while I needed to reload the page for every test, because the player was falling out the canvas. The little black square look like a prisoner in an invisible prison now :c

### Day 2: January 12, 2017 - Refactoring

**Today's Progress**: Loooooot of refactoring. On a friend repo and on a private repo containing a game engine.

**Thoughts**: Refactoring someone else code was kind of funny. The code was monolitic with some duplicated code, so there were works to do. Didn't commit yet tho.

### Day 3: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some research about air physics in a jump

**Thoughts**: The physics are already pretty neat, but they use linear functions. I have to try more physics calculation, like exponential functions or square functions.

### Day 4: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set two new projects up

**Thoughts**: I just started two new repo to test few things about microservices. Can't wait to see what kind of stuff my researches will lead to !

### Day 5: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring. Refactoring. Refactoring. Did I miss something ?

**Thoughts**: Weeeeeeell, lot of work to refactor a forked repo. So much to do. Send help.

## RESTART
### Day 1: May 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set one new project up

**Thoughts**: I just started one new repo about rpc through http and tis implemetation in an async code.

### Day 2: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project (again) about services communication with AMQP protocol

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I tried to build a service to service communication system, easy to use and maintain. I think it started great ! :D
