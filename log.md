# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some neat physics to player movements

**Thoughts**: Well, after adding the jump, I kind of forgot that x and y speed values added each other. I'll have to use... VECTOR CALCULATIONS. Thankfully, I already did that in previous projects.

### Day 2: January 12, 2017 - Jump Research

**Today's Progress**: Added boundaries to the world to prevent player from falling or walking out the canvas

**Thoughts**: Testing jump was a LITTLE annoying while I needed to reload the page for every test, because the player was falling out the canvas. The little black square look like a prisoner in an invisible prison now :c

### Day 2: January 12, 2017 - Refactoring

**Today's Progress**: Loooooot of refactoring. On a friend repo and on a private repo containing a game engine.

**Thoughts**: Refactoring someone else code was kind of funny. The code was monolitic with some duplicated code, so there were works to do. Didn't commit yet tho.

### Day 3: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some research about air physics in a jump

**Thoughts**: The physics are already pretty neat, but they use linear functions. I have to try more physics calculation, like exponential functions or square functions.
