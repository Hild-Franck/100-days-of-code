# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some neat physics to player movements

**Thoughts**: Well, after adding the jump, I kind of forgot that x and y speed values added each other. I'll have to use... VECTOR CALCULATIONS. Thankfully, I already did that in previous projects.
